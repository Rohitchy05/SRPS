        <p>The rules of Xtreme Rock Paper Scissors are very simple</p>
        <p>You and the computer will begin with x number of every card</p>
        <p>You will both choose to play a card and as usual rock beats
            scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.</p>
        <p>However, the loser will lose the card they played and the
            winner will gain that card. So, if you play rock and the
            computer plays paper then you lose a rock card and the computer
            gains a rock card.</p>
        <p>In the event of a draw, both sides keep their cards and go again.</p>
        <p>Both sides keep playing until one side runs out of cards.</p>
